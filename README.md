### Title
Enhancing Movie Recommender Accuracy - A Comprehensive Study on Hyperparameter Optimization and Genre-Specific Error Analysis in Spark

### Overview
This project by Sai Sanwariya Narayan aims to enhance the accuracy of a movie recommendation system built in Apache Spark. It focuses on optimizing hyperparameters of an ALS (Alternating Least Squares) model and conducting a detailed error analysis by genre. The study includes tasks like computing average prediction error for movies and genres, analyzing the impact of review count on prediction error, and employing Spark DataFrame and RDD transformations for effective data processing.

### Program Functionality
1. **Data Preparation**: Load and preprocess movie and ratings data into Spark DataFrames and RDDs.
2. **Model Building**: Construct an ALS model using the best hyperparameters identified in a previous study.
3. **Model Evaluation**: Use the ALS model to generate predictions, calculate prediction errors, and join RDDs/DataFrames for analysis.
4. **Analysis**: 
   - Compute average prediction error for each movie.
   - Examine the correlation between the number of reviews and prediction error.
   - Analyze prediction errors by movie genres.
   - Use Sparkâ€™s `persist()` and `unpersist()` methods for performance optimization.
5. **Output Generation**: Save the analyzed data in a CSV format for further examination and insights.

### Notes
- The project utilizes PySpark, Pandas, NumPy, and related libraries for data handling and analysis.
- A Jupyter Notebook environment is used for development and testing purposes.
- Careful attention is given to error handling and resource management in Spark to ensure efficient performance.
- The results are stored in CSV format for easy access and further research or development.
